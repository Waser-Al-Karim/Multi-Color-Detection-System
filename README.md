# Real-time Color and Object Detection System

## This project is capable of detecting multiple colors utilizing the OpenCV. It calculates the hsv color range of the live images. Based on that it predicts the color.
A web-based app is also implemented. It continuously searches for the color and objects and shows the results by capturing images.

Instructions: 

> The main python file is on the venv folder named red.py
> The steamlit app can be found on the venv folder named steampit.py
